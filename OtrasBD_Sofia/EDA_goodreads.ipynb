Much has changed here in the ol\\' U.S. of A. since Bryson left, and in <i> I\\'m A Stranger Here Myself</i>, he recounts, in hilarious fashion, his struggles to successfully repatriate himself. In this excerpt, Bryson compares and contrasts the U.S. Postal Service with Britain\\'s Royal Mail.</p> <h3>Jeff Stark</h3> <p><P>There are two sorts of columnists worth reading. One is the expert -- someone like Robert Christgau of the <i>Village Voice</i>, a guy who\\'s breathed music for 30 years and knows more about the subject than <i>Billboard</i> does. The other kind is simply fascinating -- someone like Louis Lapham of <i>Harper\\'s Magazine</i>, who can make a connection between Louis XIV\\'s court and Reagan\\'s cabinet one month and write on cultural commodification the next. <P> Bill Bryson, the author of the set of columns collected in <i>I\\'m a Stranger Here Myself</i>, is neither fascinating nor an expert. He\\'s an American who wrote travel books and newspapered in England for 20 years before returning to New Hampshire with his wife and family in 1996. He\\'s also the author of the 1998 bestseller <i>A Walk in the Woods</i>, a travel diary that details his aborted attempts to hike the entire length of the Appalachian Trail. <P>The best parts of <i>A Walk in the Woods</i> worked because not much happened along the trail; in order to fill in the holes, Bryson became something of an expert, studying and researching people, flora, fauna, history and park politics. There\\'s none of that rigor in <i>I\\'m a Stranger Here Myself</i>, a coattail collection of columns, originally written for the British magazine <i>Night & Day</i>, that examine the minutiae of American life in neat four-page chunks. In one piece the subject is a small-town post office on customer-appreciation day; in another it\\'s the tedium of highway driving. Nostalgia accounts for several essays about motels, drive-in theaters, small-town living and the beauty of Thanksgiving. <P>An editor of mine once told me that any writer you give a column to sooner or later ends up writing about television; he believed that writers are lazy people who would rather turn on the idiot box than get out of their bathrobes and report. Bryson starts writing about television in his third column. (He misses coming home drunk in England and watching lectures on <i>Open University</i>.) That column sets up a trap that he falls into for the rest of his book: Almost all of his subjects come to him. An article in the <i>Atlantic Monthly</i> becomes a column about the ludicrous drug war; a box of dental floss works itself into a confused meditation on consumer warnings and born worriers; a catalog prompts a thousand words on shopping. His laziness is contagious: If you read several columns in one sitting, you get to the point where you start skipping over weak leads (\"The other day something in our local newspaper caught my eye\"; \"I decided to clean out the refrigerator the other day\"). <P>Bryson tries to make up for his reportorial torpor with jokes, as if he thinks we\\'re more likely to enjoy a few strung-together paragraphs about barbershops if there\\'s a zinger about Wayne Newton\\'s hair at the end. He also relies on several crutches to get him through his weekly deadlines. Having returned to the States, he trades in the English smirk at absurdity for cudgeling exaggerations -- \"help the National Rifle Association with its Arm-a-Toddler campaign\" -- and he wraps almost every piece with a tacked-on paragraph that <P>To be fair, he\\'s occasionally funny. (In a story about snowmobiling: \"The next thing I knew I was on the edge of the New Hampshire woods, wearing a snug, heavy helmet that robbed me of all my senses except terror.\") And in a few columns -- one on sending his son off to school, another about why autumn leaves change colors -- he actually invests either himself or his resources enough to give the work emotional or intellectual ballast. <P>Those moments are dismally few. When Bryson\\'s editor at <i>Night & Day</i> persuaded him to write a column on American life for a British audience, he probably imagined something like Alexis de Tocqueville channeled through Dave Barry. What he got instead was the observational humor of a second-rate Seinfeld leafing through the mail in his bathrobe. -- <i>Salon</i></p>', 'overview': '<p>After living in Britain for two decades, Bill Bryson recently moved back to the United States with his English wife and four children (he had read somewhere that nearly 3 million Americans believed they had been abducted by aliens—as he later put it, \"it was clear my people needed me\").&nbsp;&nbsp;They were greeted by a new and improved America that boasts microwave pancakes, twenty-four-hour dental-floss hotlines, and the staunch conviction that ice is not a luxury item.</p>\\n<p>Delivering the brilliant comic musings that are a Bryson hallmark, <b>I\\'m a Stranger Here Myself</b> recounts his sometimes disconcerting reunion with the land of his birth.&nbsp;&nbsp;The result is a book filled with hysterical scenes of one man\\'s attempt to reacquaint himself with his own country, but it is also an extended if at times bemused love letter to the homeland he has returned to after twenty years away.</p>', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/38/20/9780767903820.jpg', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780767931182', 'binding': 'printisbn'}]}}\n",

It sorts lessons and units into consistent plans that teachers, schools, and districts can access to ensure content is consistent and also progresses along with students. Jacobs and her contributors describe how to set up a mapping project, work on the project as a team, and use mapping in special settings such as in an independent or alternative school. They show how to create consistent benchmarks and use the resulting maps to integrate new technology, new data, decision-making structures, and staff development opportunities.

In the prophetic year of 1984, <i>Dune</i> was made into a motion picture directed by David Lynch, and it has recently been produced as a three-part miniseries on the Sci-Fi Channel.

Compulsively readable, despite the often extraneous detail, the biography explores the evolution of a \"modern day Socrates\" who \"tore into... unexamined linguistic and cultural assumptions,\" extrapolating \"words and traditions he thought might exist in the future.\" At age eight, Herbert, the child of impoverished, \"on-again, off-again alcoholic\" parents, announced, \"I wanna be a author\" and went on to sell his first short story at 17. Brian charts the influences on his father\\'s masterpiece, from T.E. Lawrence and Jung to world religions, particularly Zen Buddhism. The author also depicts the symbiotic relationship between Herbert and his second wife, Beverly (Brian\\'s mother), a talented copywriter, but admits that Herbert, an incessant nitpicker, never quite accepted \"number two son\" Bruce\\'s gay lifestyle and regularly used a lie detector on both boys. Estranged for many years, Brian and his father eventually made peace, learning \"how to talk story\" and collaborating on Man of Two Worlds (1986) shortly before Frank\\'s death from cancer at age 65. This moving, sometimes painfully obsessive biography is an impressive testament of family loyalty and love. A must-read for Herbert fans (both senior and junior), it includes family photos and a bibliography. (Apr. 14) Forecast: Brian Herbert is the author of The Dune Concordance, a trilogy of Dune prequels written with Kevin J. Anderson, as well as the first volume in a second prequel trilogy (also co-written with Anderson), Dune: The Butlerian Jihad (Forecasts, Sept. 9, 2002). The airing of a miniseries based on Children of Dune on the Sci-Fi channel in March will give this an extra lift.

Hobbiton, Rivendell, and Minas Tirith are no longer designations on the map. Literally hundreds of designers and craftspeople have been painstakingly adding authentic cultural details to each of more than 48,000 separate objects shown in The Fellowship of the Ring, from armor to props to architecture. All this and more is shown in Gary Russell’s lavishly illustrated book. Russell spent time on the set in New Zealand, conducting interviews with director Peter Jackson, special effects guru Richard Taylor, art directors Paul Lasainne, Dan Hennah, and Chris Hennah, costumer Ngila Dickson, and Alan Lee and John Howe. Featuring everything from pencil sketches to the finished objects, his book gives detailed descriptions of why and how this groundbreaking film looks as exciting as it does.

And what if you knew in advance exactly what to focus on so that you could utterly destroy your old patterns?<P>The Power of an Hour gives you the blueprint for making changes one at a time that add up to a big difference.

This Travelogue Of The Adventure Is A Small Miracle Of Persistence And Speed, Since Mcgregor And Boorman Finished Their Trip Mere Months Ago, And Though In Some Places The Rush Job Shows, It's Readable And Entertaining, Told In The Actors' Alternating Voices.

Roads In The Former Soviet Nations Were The Biggest And Most Consistent Obstacles, Sometimes In Such Poor Shape That The Authors' Progress Slowed To Less Than 20 Miles A Day (and This On A 20,000-mile Trip).

Thankfully, in addition to a magnificent literary legacy—which includes seven novels and three co-authored works of nonfiction—Douglas left us something more.

Another Section Addresses The Thorny Issue Of Who Contributed What To The Zany Plot Line Of The Radio Series And How Adams's Collaborator, John Lloyd, Was Nudged Out Of The Book Deal.

Franḳfurṭ ; Targum Efrat Avisrur.', 'language': 'en', 'overview': '<p>One of the most salient features of our culture is that there is so much bullshit. Everyone knows this. Each of us contributes his share. But we tend to take the situation for granted. Most people are rather confident of their ability to recognize bullshit and to avoid being taken in by it. So the phenomenon has not aroused much deliberate concern. We have no clear understanding of what bullshit is, why there is so much of it, or what functions it serves. And we lack a conscientiously developed appreciation of what it means to us. In other words, as Harry Frankfurt writes, \"we have no theory.\"</p>\\n<p>Frankfurt, one of the world\\'s most influential moral philosophers, attempts to build such a theory here. With his characteristic combination of philosophical acuity, psychological insight, and wry humor, Frankfurt proceeds by exploring how bullshit and the related concept of humbug are distinct from lying. He argues that bullshitters misrepresent themselves to their audience not as liars do, that is, by deliberately making false claims about what is true. In fact, bullshit need not be untrue at all.</p>\\n<p>Rather, bullshitters seek to convey a certain impression of themselves without being concerned about whether anything at all is true. They quietly change the rules governing their end of the conversation so that claims about truth and falsity are irrelevant. Frankfurt concludes that although bullshit can take many innocent forms, excessive indulgence in it can eventually undermine the practitioner\\'s capacity to tell the truth in a way that lying does not. Liars at least acknowledge that it matters what is true.

Along the way, Klosterman opines on rock music, never afraid to offend-as when he interprets a Radiohead album as a 9/11 prophecy or reminds readers that before Kurt Cobain\\'s suicide, many preferred Pearl Jam to Nirvana. The quest to uncover these deaths\\' social significance is quickly overwhelmed by Klosterman\\'s personal obsessions, especially his agonizing over sexual relationships. He applies semifictional techniques to these concerns, inventing an imaginary conversation in the car with three girlfriends that becomes the book\\'s centerpiece. This literary cleverness recalls classic gonzo journalism, but also contains a self-conscious edge, inviting comparison to Dave Eggers. Klosterman also worries his neuroses will brand him as \"the male Elizabeth Wurtzel,\" but he needn\\'t fret.

            "{'book': {'publisher': 'Farrar, Straus and Giroux', 'synopsys': \"<p>Biting, witty, provocative, and sardonic, Bernard Malamud's <i> The Natural</i> is widely considered to be the premier basebal novel of all time. It tells the story of Roy Hobbs&#151;an athlete born with rare and wondrous gifts&#151;who is robbed of his prime playing years by a youthful indiscretion that nearly consts him his life. But at an age when most players are considering retirement, Roy reenters the game, lifting the lowly New York Knights from last place into pennant contention and becoming an instant hero in the process. Now all he has to worry about is the fixers, the boss, the slump, the jinx, the fans...and the dangerously seductive Memo Paris, the one woman Roy can't seem to get out of his mind.</p><h3>Harry Sylvester</h3><p>Back in the thirties the baseball writers making the swing through the West with the major league teams occasionally wondered whether one of their number would ever produce a serious novel about baseball. That novel has finally been written-- and if the author does not come from the ranks of baseball reporters, at least he hails from Brooklyn and there are those who feel that qualifies him ex officio. It&#39;s an unusually fine novel, too although I don&#39;t know how the professionals are going to take it. For Bernard Malamud&#39;s interests go far beyond baseball. What he has done is to contrive a sustained and elaborate allegory in which the &quot;natural&quot; player--who operates with ease and the greatest skill, without having been taught-- is equated with the natural man who, left alone by, say, politicians and advertising agencie, might achieve his real fulfillment...</p>\", 'language': 'en_US', 'overview': '<p><b>The classical novel (and basis for the acclaimed film) now in a new edition</b></p>\\n<p>Introduction by Kevin Baker</p>\\n<p><i>The Natural</i>, Bernard Malamud’s first novel, published in 1952, is also the first—and some would say still the best—novel ever written about baseball. In it Malamud, usually appreciated for his unerring portrayals of postwar Jewish life, took on very different material—the story of a superbly gifted “natural” at play in the fields of the old daylight baseball era—and invested it with the hardscrabble poetry, at once grand and altogether believable, that runs through all his best work. Four decades later, Alfred Kazin’s comment still holds true: “Malamud has done something which—now that he has done it!—looks as if we have been waiting for it all our lives.

It is a game, a cryptographic chess match between Waterhouse and his German counterpart, translated into action by the gung-ho Shaftoe and his forces.</p>\\n<p>Fast-forward to the present, where Waterhouse\\'s crypto-hacker grandson, Randy, is attempting to create a \"data haven\" in Southeast Asia — a place where encrypted data can be stored and exchanged free of repression and scrutiny. As governments and multinationals attack the endeavor, Randy joins forces with Shaftoe\\'s tough-as-nails granddaughter, Amy, to secretly salvage a sunken Nazi submarine that holds the key to keeping the dream of a data haven afloat. But soon their scheme brings to light a massive conspiracy with its roots in Detachment 2702 linked to an unbreakable Nazi code called Arethusa. And it will represent the path to unimaginable riches and a future of personal and digital liberty...or to universal totalitarianism reborn.</p>\\n<p>A breathtaking tour de force, and Neal Stephenson\\'s mostaccomplished and affecting work to date.|</p>', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/28/04/9780060512804.jpg', 'title_long': 'Cryptonomicon', 'edition': 'Reprint', 'dimensions': 'Height: 6.75 Inches, Length: 4.1875 Inches, Weight: 1.19 Pounds, Width: 1.75375 Inches', 'pages': 1168, 'date_published': '2002', 'subjects': ['World War, 1939-1945--Cryptography', 'World War, 1939-1945--Cryptography--Fiction', 'Data encryption (Computer science)', 'Data encryption (Computer science)--Fiction', 'PS3569.T3868 C79 2002', 'PZ4.S836 Cry 2002', '813.54'], 'authors': ['Stephenson, Neal'], 'title': 'Cryptonomicon', 'isbn13': '9780060512804', 'msrp': '4.49', 'binding': 'Mass Market Paperback', 'related': {'Kindle Edition': '0061792578'}, 'isbn': '0060512806', 'other_isbns': [{'isbn': '9780061792571', 'binding': 'print'}]}}\n",

The fault, argues this fascinating, ingenious—even liberating—book, lies not in ourselves, but in product design that ignores the needs of users and the principles of cognitive psychology.The problems range from ambiguous and hidden controls to arbitrary relationships between controls and functions, coupled with a lack of feedback or other assistance and unreasonable demands on memorization. The book presents examples aplenty—among them, the VCR, computer, and office telephone, all models of how not to design for people.But good, usable design is possible. The rules are simple: make things visible, exploit natural relationships that couple function and control, and make intelligent use of constraints. The goal: guide the user effortlessly to the right action on the right control at the right time.

Their journey takes them on a chauffeur-driven, midnight run away from New York City to Atlantic City where they gamble away most of Mehlmanís remaining funds and then North, to Albany, where he finds unlikely salvation and the inspiration for his book, <i>Polish-Jewish Cuisine in 69 Recipes</i>.</p>\\n<p>Framed by Mehlmanís sonís account of his famous father, this novel-within-a-novel is a darkly hilarious tale of a writerís fall and his subsequent rise. <i>Phantom Pain</i> has all the characteristic mixture of slapstick and stark despair that has made Arnon Grunberg one of the most interesting, certainly the funniest, and arguably the best Dutch writer working today.</p>', 'image': 'https://images.isbndb.com/covers/12/68/9781590511268.jpg', 'subjects': ['Novelists, American', 'Novelists, American--Fiction', 'PT5881.17.R96 F3613 2004']}}\n",

Among the author\\'s favorites were his books about shrewd and compassionate Inspector Maigret, conceived by Simenon in 1931 after he left Belgium to live in Paris. As Marnham ( Trail of Havoc: In the Steps of Lord Lucan ) shows, the hero of Simenon\\'s superb French policiers is quite different from his creator. The author\\'s life was turbulent: he was sexually obsessed; he abandoned his wife and son to marry a woman who was as promiscuous as he was; he coupled with his maids. Simenon himself revealed much of this in his last book, Intimate Memoirs, addressed to his only daughter, Marie-Jo, after she committed suicide at age 23 in 1978. Marnham\\'s scrupulous study of this memoir and of Simenon\\'s Belgian family background lay bare Simenon\\'s fantomes. This is a story of an enigma, a man more extraordinary than any character in his perennial bestsellers, and certainly nothing like the admirable Maigret. Photos not seen by PW.
